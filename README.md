#FLEX WEBSITE LAYOUT PROJECT

###Overview
- This project demonstrates the power of CSS Flexbox for creating, dynamic, responsive web layouts without relying on complex grid systems. The layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tables, and mobile devices. 

###Features
- **Fully Responsive Design:** Seamlessly adapts to any screen size
- **Flexbox-Based Layout:** Utilizes modern CSS Flexbox properties for efficient layout management
- **Modular Components:** Header, hero section, card layout, content sections, and footer all use flexbox

###Key Flexbox Properties Used
- `display: flex`: Applied to container elements to create flex containers
- `flex-direction`: Controls the direction of flex items(row, column)
- `justify-content`: Aligns items along the main axis(horizontal spacing)
- `align-items`: Aligns items along the cross axis(vertical spacing)
- `flex-wrap`: Controls whether items wrap to new lines when space is limited 
- `gap`: Creates consistent spacing between flex items 
- `flex` shorthand: Combines flex-grow, flex-shring, and flex-basis properties 

###Usage
